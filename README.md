# ML_Vision_Projects
This repository features two distinct machine learning projects focused on **computer vision** and **image classification**. The projects demonstrate skills in model development and real world application of image analysis.


## Projects
### 1. Panda Detection using YOLOv8

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | This project uses the **YOLOv8 model** from the Ultralytics framework. |
| **Goal** | The notebook demonstrates **object detection**. It loads a pre-trained model and runs inference on a test image. |
| **Output** | The process identifies objects and produces **bounding boxes** with **confidence scores**. |
| **Location** | Find the details and code in the [Panda Detection](./Panda_detection) folder. |

### 2. Plant Health Prediction

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technology** | This project develops a **Convolutional Neural Network classifier**. It uses **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. |
| **Goal** | The objective is to **predict plant diseases accurately** from leaf images. This assists agricultural specialists in early disease detection. |
| **Impact** | Enabling the accurate identification of diseases to support **timely** agricultural intervention. |
| **Location** | Find the details and code in the [Dead Plant Prediction](./Dead_Plant_Prediction/) folder. |

### 3. Vehicle Counting Web Application

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Technology** | Flask based web application using **OpenCV** for computer vision processing. |
| **Goal** | Detect and **count vehicles** from video streams or recorded footage. |
| **Features** | Frame processing, vehicle detection, and count visualization through a web interface. |
| **Location** | Find the details and code in the [Count Vehicle App](./Count_Vehicle_app/) folder. |
